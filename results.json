    "Real-World Relevance": {
      "score": 3,
      "reason": "The article briefly mentions applications in physics, engineering, and computer science, but does not deeply explore concrete real-world scenarios where vector spaces naturally arise."
    },
    "Motivating Examples": {
      "score": 3,
      "reason": "Several standard examples (Euclidean space, function spaces, polynomial spaces) are provided, but they are described briefly and not in a step-by-step way that builds intuitive motivation."
    },
    "Visual & Symbolic Support": {
      "score": 3,
      "reason": "Some diagrams and symbolic expressions appear, but the article is heavily text- and notation-based, with limited visuals that could help learners grasp geometric intuition."
    },
    "Gradual Progression": {
      "score": 3,
      "reason": "The structure follows a logical path from definitions to examples to subspaces and linear maps, but the abstraction increases quickly and may overwhelm learners without prior linear algebra experience."
    },
    "Balance of Intuition and Formalism": {
      "score": 2,
      "reason": "The article leans strongly toward formal definitions and axioms, offering limited intuitive explanations about what vector spaces represent or why the axioms matter."
    },
    "Multiple Representations (visual, symbolic, verbal)": {
      "score": 3,
      "reason": "Vector spaces are described symbolically and verbally, with some geometric mentions, but the article lacks rich visual representations that are helpful for beginners."
    },
    "Accessibility and Structure": {
      "score": 3,
      "reason": "The article is well-organized, but the high level of abstraction and heavy notation reduce accessibility for readers encountering the topic for the first time."
    },
    "Multiple Proofs or Perspectives": {
      "score": 4,
      "reason": "The article provides several perspectives—axiomatic, geometric, algebraic, and functional-analytic—showing the breadth of the concept even if explicit proofs are not central."
    },
    "Applications and Impact": {
      "score": 3,
      "reason": "Applications are mentioned but not deeply illustrated, giving readers only a partial understanding of why vector spaces are so fundamental to modern mathematics and applied fields."
    }
  },
  "total_score": 30,
  "overall_summary": "The vector space article provides a clear and thorough formal definition along with several examples and perspectives useful for intermediate or advanced learners. However, it leans heavily toward abstraction and formalism, offering limited intuitive explanations, visuals, or real-world motivations. This makes it challenging as an introductory learning resource. With additional intuitive examples, geometric interpretations, and concrete applications, the article would be significantly more accessible and educational for beginners."

    },
    "Visual & Symbolic Support": {
      "score": 3,
      "reason": "There are some diagrams and historical images, but the article does not include conceptual visuals that explain AI models, architectures, or learning processes in depth."
    },
    "Gradual Progression": {
      "score": 4,
      "reason": "The article progresses well from definitions to history, subfields, techniques, and applications, providing a coherent high-level learning pathway even if some jumps between sections are broad."
    },
    "Balance of Intuition and Formalism": {
      "score": 4,
      "reason": "The article emphasizes conceptual understanding and avoids excessive mathematical detail, balancing accessibility with accurate descriptions of AI techniques."
    },
    "Multiple Representations (visual, symbolic, verbal)": {
      "score": 3,
      "reason": "Most content is verbal; visuals and symbolic explanations appear but are limited, leaving some technical ideas underrepresented in alternative formats."
    },
    "Accessibility and Structure": {
      "score": 4,
      "reason": "The article is well-structured and uses accessible language for a general audience, though some technical terms may still challenge beginners."
